# LPIC3-303-328.3: Packet Filtering

## The Theory

**NOTE:** The commands below must be run as the root user or user with privileges to access `iptables`.

There are 3 CHAINS. These are INPUT, FORWARD and OUTPUT. 
* **INPUT** - Used to control the behavior of INCOMING connections.
* **FORWARD** - Used to control the behavior of connections that aren't delivered locally but sent immediately out. (i.e.: router)
* **OUTPUT** - Used to control the behavior of OUTGOING connections.

```
~$ sudo iptables -L | grep policy

Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         
ACCEPT     tcp  --  192.168.1.32         anywhere             multiport dports http,https

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination         

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
```
